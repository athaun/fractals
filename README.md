# Running Code: 

Currently working on an interface to allow for other generators. 

To run one of the examples in Main.py, uncomment out the block of code corresponding to the example to be run. To specify stage, change the 2nd parameter in the run_simulation call in main.py (note: recommend to use smaller numbers since the time to completion grows exponentially)
